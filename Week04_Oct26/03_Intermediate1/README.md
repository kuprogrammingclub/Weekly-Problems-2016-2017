### Description
Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing between the numbers 1, 2, ..., 9 (in this order) such that the result is always 100. For example: 1 + 2 + 34 – 5 + 67 – 8 + 9 = 100.


#### Furthermore
If you're looking for inspiration on a language to use, here's a basic tutorial for [Java](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/2853/Java-Basics-Input-and-Output) and [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/basic_io/).  If you check out
the README under the Weekly-Problems-2016-2017 there are many more resources
available to start learning different languages!
