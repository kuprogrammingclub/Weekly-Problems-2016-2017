### Description
Allow  a user to input any number of integers and insert these numbers into a list. Write three different functions that computes the sum using a for-loop, a while-loop, and recursion (Optional, I know some haven't learned recursion. Always challenge yourself though!)

```
Enter numbers to be summed:
> 9
> 20
> 23
> -10
Sum from for-loop: 42
Sum from while-loop: 42
Sum from recursion: 42
```

### Furthermore
If you're looking for inspiration on a language to use, here's a basic tutorial
for [Java](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/2853/Java-Basics-Input-and-Output)
and [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/basic_io/).  If you check out
the README under the Weekly-Problems-2016-2017 there are many more resources
available to start learning different languages!
