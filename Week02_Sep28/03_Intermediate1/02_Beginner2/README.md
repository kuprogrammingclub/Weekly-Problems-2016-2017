### Description
Modify the previous program [from 01_Beginner1] such that only multiples of
three or five are considered in the sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 for n=17

Example 1:

```
Would you like to compute the sum or the product? (+ for sum, x for product)
> +
What number would you like to sum to?
> 9
The sum from 1 to 9 only including multiples of 3 and 5 is 23.
```

Example 2:

```
Would you like to compute the sum or the product? (+ for sum, x for product)
> x
What number would you like to compute the product to?
> 9
The product from 1 to 9 only including multiples of 3 and 5 is 810.
```

If you're looking for inspiration on a language to use, here's a basic tutorial for [Java](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/2853/Java-Basics-Input-and-Output) and [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/basic_io/).  If you check out
the README under the Weekly-Problems-2016-2017 there are many more resources
available to start learning different languages!
