### Note
This will hopefully be easy enough, to get you started with python.  You might
have to do a little research on how to get started with python.  Google and
StackOverflow is your friend!

Python is built into most Linux distributions and all the EECS computers.
It is a little more work to get it working on Windows, but not by much.

### Description
Read two integers from STDIN and print three lines where:

The first line contains the sum of the two numbers.
The second line contains the difference of the two numbers (first - second).
The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

### Input Format
The first line contains the first integer, a. The second line contains the second integer, b.

### Constraints
1 <= a <= 10^10
1 <= b <= 10^10

### Output Format
Print the three lines as explained above.

### Sample Input
```

### Furthermore
If you're looking for inspiration on a language to use, here's a basic tutorial
for [Java](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/2853/Java-Basics-Input-and-Output)
and [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/basic_io/).  If you check out
the README under the Weekly-Problems-2016-2017 there are many more resources
available to start learning different languages!
