## Intermediate 2 - Linked List Addition
__*Source*__: Cracking The Coding Interview (5th Edition)

You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a
single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is
at the head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns
the sum as a linked list.

#### Sample Input
```
List A: 7 -> 1 -> 6
List B: 5 -> 9 -> 2

That is, 617 + 295.
```

#### Sample Output
```
2 -> 1 -> 9.
```

If you're looking for inspiration on a language to use, here's a basic tutorial for [Java](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/2853/Java-Basics-Input-and-Output) and [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/basic_io/).  If you check out
the README under the Weekly-Problems-2016-2017 there are many more resources
available to start learning different languages!
